# Goals and Audience

## Goals

* to be concise, easy-to-read, quick reference and jumping off point for 
  beginner-to-intermediate Haskell users. A couple paragraphs at most for each 
  item.
* to not enumerate every possible option, or every pro/con. 
* to remove choice and offer "safe bets" or starting points for readers. 
* to trust readers to venture out on their own if they have questions about the 
  details. For example, suggesting a lens library is in scope; explaning what 
  lenses are and how they work is not.

## Audience

* Users who are familiar with the basics of the language and is making their 
  first few from-scratch applications.
* Any user who wants a quick reference of the established, most-used libraries 
  and a brief explanation of their tradeoffs.

# Formatting

* pandoc-flavored markdown
* 80-char max line width
* Trailing whitespace indicates that a paragraph continues. No trailing 
  whitespace indicates the end of a paragraph (`fo+=w`)
